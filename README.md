# IEDB pipeline
The scripts form a two part data pipeline held under the GNU General Public License v3.0. Together the code automates screening the flavivirus genome for putative shared CD8 epitopes between ZIKV and other mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFV). The pipeline uses the IEDB MHC-I binding prediction tools, and requires a download version of this API which is available here http://tools.iedb.org/static/main/binding_data_2013.zip. 

The code is written in 'modern Perl5', requiring v5.14 or above (command "perl -v to check) and the first stage of data pipeline iedb_alignment_run.pl passes all viruses in any pre-specified number of alignments into the MHC-I binding prediction tools API. 

The second stage of the code iedb_output_parse.pl, parses and analyses the output of IEDB to assess the percentage amino acid identity between a shared CD8 epitope between ZIKV and a given MBFV, and the total number of shared epitopes above a percentage threshold.

# Amino bootscan pipeline
These scripts are written in Python 3.7 making strong use of BioPython and ETE3 amongst other dependencies. Whilst IEDB is pretty much ready to go and would be very easy to modulise, you will need a clear understanding of Python to use 'Amino Bootscan'. Please note, this script is under further development towards producing a full API
